#C++ Toolbox
This C++ Toolbox project provides a set of functions for various mathematical and string manipulations. Users can interact with the program through a console-based menu to perform operations such as checking if a number is prime, determining if a number is a palindrome, obtaining the sum of values at prime or palindromic indices in an array, generating a decreasing list of prime numbers in a range, and inverting a given string.

##Requirements
C++ compiler
Standard Template Library (STL)

##Installation

1 - Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-toolbox.git

2 - Navigate to the project directory:
cd cpp-toolbox

3 - Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler:
g++ -o toolbox main.cpp

##Usage
1 - Run the compiled program:
./toolbox

2 - Choose an option from the menu:

Option 1: Determine whether a given number is prime.
Option 2: Determine whether a given number is a palindrome.
Option 3: Get the sum of values at prime or palindromic indices in an array.
Option 4: Get a decreasing list of prime numbers in a range.
Option 5: Invert a given string.
Option 0: Exit.

3 - Follow the prompts to input values or strings as needed.
4 - Repeat the process until you choose to exit the program.
